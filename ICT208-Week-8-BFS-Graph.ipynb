    "\n",
    "Breadth-First Search (**BFS**) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores vertices in layers. It starts at a given vertex and explores all its neighboring vertices first, before moving on to their neighbors, and so on. This approach makes BFS different from DFS, which explores as deep as possible in one direction before backtracking.\n",

    "   - We dequeue vertex `1` and visit it.\n",
    "   - Vertex `1` is connected to vertices `0`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.\n",
    "   - Vertices `0` and `3` have already been visited, so we ignore them.\n",
    "   - We enqueue vertices `2` and `4` and mark them as visited.\n",

    "### Explanation of the BFS Output:\n",
    "- **Order of Traversal**:\n",
    "  - BFS starts at vertex `0`.\n",
    "  - It visits all direct neighbors of `0` first (vertices `1` and `3`).\n",
    "  - Then it proceeds to visit the neighbors of `1` (which include `2` and `4`).\n",
    "  - Finally, it visits the remaining vertices in the order they were enqueued (`2` and `4`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key Points**:\n",
    "  - BFS explores a graph **level-by-level**: it first explores all direct neighbors of the current vertex before moving on to deeper levels.\n",
    "  - BFS uses a **queue** to keep track of the order in which vertices should be explored, which ensures that all neighbors of a vertex are explored before moving to deeper neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difference Between DFS and BFS:\n",
    "- **DFS** explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, leading to a more \"depth-first\" approach.\n",
    "- **BFS** explores all vertices at the same level first, then moves deeper level by level, making it more \"breadth-first.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the traversal order is different from what we would get with DFS. BFS traverses vertices `1` and `3` (the neighbors of `0`) before moving on to `2` and `4`.\n",
